# Proxy Boy

A man in the middle server to proxy requests by!

Currently a work in progress. Also, only works with HTTP requests right now (SSL is not implemented)

Does not work with python2.

# Usage

#### Webserver

Run the following command

```bash
python main.py <port>
```

where `<port>` is whatever port you would like for your proxy server to run at. The default is port 1234.
